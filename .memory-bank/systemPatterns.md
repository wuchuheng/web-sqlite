# System Patterns: Current OOP Architecture Analysis

## Current Architecture Overview

### Main Components
1. **SQLiteWASMDemo** - Application orchestrator class
2. **DatabaseManager** - Database operations and worker communication
3. **UIController** - UI state management and event handling

### Key Patterns Currently Used

#### 1. Class-Based Architecture
```javascript
class SQLiteWASMDemo {
  constructor() { /* initialization */ }
  async initialize() { /* setup */ }
  cleanup() { /* teardown */ }
}
```

#### 2. Event-Driven Communication
- Custom event system in DatabaseManager
- UI responds to database events (connect, disconnect, queryComplete)
- Global error handling and logging

#### 3. Web Worker Integration
- SQLite runs in dedicated worker thread
- Message-based communication with Promise wrapping
- Timeout handling for long-running operations

#### 4. State Management
- Mutable instance variables across classes
- Scattered state in multiple objects
- Event listeners stored in class properties

## Technical Dependencies

### Core Technologies
- SQLite WebAssembly module
- Web Workers API
- Origin Private File System (OPFS)
- DOM manipulation

### File Structure
```
js/
├── main.js           - Application initialization & orchestration
├── database-manager.js - SQLite worker communication
└── ui-controller.js   - DOM manipulation & event handling
```

## Current Design Issues to Address

### 1. Redundant Storage Support
- Memory database support (not needed - OPFS only)
- Multiple VFS options (simplify to OPFS only)
- Complex configuration options

### 2. Scattered State Management
- State spread across multiple class instances
- Mutable properties make debugging difficult
- Event system complexity

### 3. OOP Overhead
- Classes used where simple functions would suffice
- Method binding and `this` context issues
- Complex inheritance patterns not utilized

## Refactoring Strategy

### Target Patterns
1. **Pure Functions**: Replace classes with composable functions
2. **Immutable State**: Central state object passed through functions
3. **Event Streams**: Functional reactive patterns for UI updates
4. **Module Pattern**: Self-contained functional modules
